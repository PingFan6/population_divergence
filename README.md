# Step1
Calculate the pairwise results used the "Calculate_pairwise_function.R" 
You can find the R script and instruction about that script at the link: https://github.com/PingFan6/estimating-haplotype-diversity

When you finished this step, You will get the Pairwise result of each species.

#Step2
Calculate the population divergence using the "Population_divergence.R"
Input data: The results of Step 1 (Pairwise result of each species) 
Output data: A data frame of the population divergence of each species saved in a CSV format file.
